🚀 AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System
📌 Overview
An AI-powered medical diagnosis web application that predicts diseases based on user-inputted symptoms. Built with Streamlit for an intuitive UI and Python for backend processing, this system leverages machine learning models such as SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest to provide real-time, accurate predictions.

🛠️ Features
✅ 🩺 Multi-Disease Prediction – Classifies multiple diseases using trained machine learning models.
✅ 🎨 User-Friendly Interface – Built with Streamlit, ensuring an interactive, modern, and responsive design.
✅ ⚡ Instant Diagnosis – Displays real-time results with probability scores for better interpretability.
✅ 📊 Data Visualization – Integrated Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for feature analysis, correlation heatmaps, and prediction probabilities.
✅ ☁️ Deployed on Streamlit Cloud – Easily accessible and scalable for real-world usage.
