# 🚀 AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System

## 📌 Overview
An AI-powered medical diagnosis web application that predicts diseases based on user-inputted symptoms. Built with Streamlit for an intuitive UI and Python for backend processing, this system leverages machine learning models such as SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest to provide real-time, accurate predictions.

## 🛠️ Features
- ✅ **🧠 Multi-Disease Prediction** – Classifies multiple diseases using trained machine learning models.
- ✅ **🎨 User-Friendly Interface** – Built with Streamlit, ensuring an interactive, modern, and responsive design.
- ✅ **⚡ Instant Diagnosis** – Displays real-time results with probability scores for better interpretability.
- ✅ **📊 Data Visualization** – Integrated Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for feature analysis, correlation heatmaps, and prediction probabilities.
- ✅ **☁️ Deployed on Streamlit Cloud** – Easily accessible and scalable for real-world usage.

## 🔹 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** Python
- **Machine Learning Models:** SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Medical-Diagnosis.git
cd AI-Medical-Diagnosis
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🎯 How It Works
1. **User Inputs Symptoms** – The user selects symptoms from a predefined list.
2. **AI Model Analysis** – The system processes inputs using ML models to predict possible diseases.
3. **Results & Insights** – Predictions are displayed along with probability scores and data visualizations.
